# DRIFT LOCK — Hard Rules (Must Follow)

You are working on PUFFF Station Vendors SA. This project is already functional.
Your job is to improve it without breaking anything.

## Absolute Rules
1. Do NOT refactor the entire project.
2. Do NOT change the architecture, folder structure, or stack unless explicitly asked.
3. Do NOT introduce new dependencies unless necessary AND explicitly approved.
4. Do NOT change existing APIs unless required for the specific task.
5. Only edit the minimum number of files needed.
6. Do ONE task at a time.
7. Always output full updated file content for every file you change.
8. Always list which files changed and why.
9. If a task could be implemented in multiple ways, choose the simplest minimal-risk option.
10. If unsure, ask before changing something structural.

## Development Safety
- Reliability over cleverness.
- Never remove smoke system or visual identity unless asked.
- Maintain the luxury black neon vibe from references.
- Must remain mobile-friendly and smooth on Android.

## Workflow
- Read `/ai/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `/ai/SPEC.md`, `/ai/DECISIONS.md`, `/ai/REFERENCES.md`, and `/ai/TASKS.md` before any work.
- Implement ONLY the next task.
- Update `/ai/TASKS.md` when done.
