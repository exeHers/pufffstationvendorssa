# UI / Vibe References — Must Match These

## Target Aesthetic
- Luxury black theme
- Neon accent lighting (cyan, purple, green, red)
- Cyberpunk tech vibe but CLEAN and premium
- Soft smoke behind product
- Rounded cards (large radius)
- Subtle shadow + glow, not harsh
- Minimal UI clutter, lots of spacing

## Layout Style
- Hero section: large bold headline, product centered, smoke behind product
- Product cards: grid layout, each card has:
  - product image
  - puff count badge
  - price
  - small specs icons (optional)
  - neon CTA button
- Cards must have:
  - dark matte background
  - slight gradient
  - slight inner border glow

## Typography
- Big bold headings
- Clean, modern sans font
- Clear hierarchy: heading > price > details > CTA
- No cheesy fonts, no overly thin fonts

## Buttons / CTAs
- Neon glow button (blue/purple/green depending on theme)
- Hover should feel premium: subtle glow increase
- No cheap gradient buttons

## Smoke
- Smoke must feel alive and neon but not overpowering
- Smoke must be BEHIND product image, not behind banner overlays
- Smoke color must match product smoke hex exactly

## Do NOT Do
- Do not rewrite layout into generic e-commerce
- Do not add cluttered “shop” UI
- Do not add bright backgrounds
- Do not flatten or remove glow/smoke vibe
- Do not add random animations everywhere
